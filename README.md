**Reflection:** What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?


**Important files to view:** 
- app.py
- templates/base.html

**Instructions** to launch prototype:

1) Clone or download this repo, saving the files to a directory
2) Open terminal and CD into the directory of the downloaded files.
3) Enter the following lines into your terminal.
> python3 -m venv venv
> . venv/bin/activate
> pip install Flask
> pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
> export FLASK_APP=app.py
> export FLASK_ENV=development
> python app.py
4) Open the link (similar to http://127.0.0.1:5000) that pops up in your terminal.

On the link, play around with the following features: <br />
1) Add a to-do list item by typing in a todo item and pressing the 'Add' button or hitting the enter key.
2) Check off the to-do list item by pressing the 'update' button next to an individual todo item.
3) Press the 'Delete' button to delete a todo item.
4)
